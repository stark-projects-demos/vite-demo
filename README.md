## Stark for Developers - Vite/Svelte Demo

This project shows how you can use Stark's GitHub integration to scan a page for accessibility issues. It's built off of our [TeamSync demo website](https://teamsync-stark.webflow.io/) which is dropped into a [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) project.

### Development

1. Run `npm install` to get all of the dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to build a local version of the site.

### Build

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. If you'd like to see a production build of the site, you can run `npm run preview`.
